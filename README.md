# Yacht Sea Dice Roller

A simple rust program that gives each player three dice rolls per turn. On each reroll after the first roll, the player can either roll all the dice again, roll some of the dice, or roll none of the dice. This was coded largely with the use of AI as an attempt to learn a bit of rust coding.
